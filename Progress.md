Pragyansh Chaturvedi : Looked up the documentations of libraries and datasheets of the sensors we will be using and tried to code using them and making connections on tinkercad. Sensors I looked up : GPS/GSM-808 mdoule, DSM501A and MICS2714
Ashutosh Singh : Familiarised myself and made basic circuit designs and 3D-models on TinkerCad. Also Looked at how to callibirate arduino based circuits.
Harshit Gupta : Started learning about Arduino uno and different components and also how to use tincker cad to make different circuits using different components . Sensors I looked for MICS2714 and MQ131 .
Chaitany Raghav : Used TinkerCad to get familiar with the input and output capabilities of the arduino and wrote basic code to light up LED in diffrent patterns.
